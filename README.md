Project Descriptions:

In this project, I conducted a detailed exploration and analysis of the Prosper Loan dataset to uncover insights into loan performance and borrower characteristics. My primary objectives were to understand the distribution and relationships of key variables, identify trends and patterns, and provide actionable insights for lenders.

Key Questions of the Analysis:

What is the distribution of Loan Original Amounts among borrowers? 

How does Borrower APR vary across the dataset?

What is the distribution of different Loan Statuses in the dataset?

How are Employment Status and Loan Status related? What is the relationship between Income Range and Loan Original Amount?

How does Debt-to-Income Ratio vary with Loan Status? What is the distribution of Debt-to-Income Ratios among borrowers?

What are the Borrower APRs in relation to their Credit Scores?

How do different Income Ranges correspond with Employment Status?

How does the Loan Original Amount relate to the Borrowerâ€™s Income Range?

Findings and Insights:

Loan Performance: Employment status and debt-to-income ratio are significant indicators of loan performance. Employed borrowers and those with lower debt-to-income ratios tend to have better loan outcomes. 

Borrower Characteristics: Higher income and higher credit scores are associated with lower APRs and larger loan amounts, suggesting that these borrowers are considered lower risk by lenders. 

Risk Assessment: Retired and not employed borrowers represent higher risk, as evidenced by higher rates of defaulted and charged-off loans.

Recommendations:

Target Marketing: Focus marketing efforts on employed individuals and those with lower debt-to-income ratios to improve loan performance.

Risk Mitigation: Implement stricter lending criteria or higher interest rates for retired and not employed borrowers to mitigate higher risks. 

Credit Score Incentives: Provide incentives for borrowers to improve their credit scores, as higher scores are linked to lower APRs and better loan performance. 

Loan Amount Adjustment: Consider adjusting loan amounts based on borrower income ranges to better align with their repayment capacities. 

Continuous Monitoring: Regularly monitor the performance of loans across different employment statuses and debt-to-income ratios to dynamically adjust lending strategies.
